Spring Framework Guestbook
--------------------------

To compile and run this example, first install maven

apt-get install maven

cd into the main directory and run

mvn spring-boot:run

The application will boot up and make itself available on port 8080.

The application requires a MySQL database named spring_guestbook to exist with a username of "username" and a
password of "password". You can change the database name, IP address, username and password by editing the
application.properties file.
